### CPSC 120

* Lab 11

    Lab 11 was a favorite because it really made me think outside the box. I really had to read the instructions clearly and figure out how to code out the file. Furthermore, I really enjoyed the process of figuring out the code and how it worked overall.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8 was another favorite because, this project was the most interesting one as we had to use a for loop to make a pattern. This was probably the most interesting one as I learned how for loops overall. Overall a really fun project.

* Lab 3

    Lab 3 was a really fun lab to do as I first had to implement math into my
    C++ code. I really enjoyed this as I was given so equations to implement into the code. I thought this was an overall super fun lab that made me think outside the box yet again.
